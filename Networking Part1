Networking is a huge field so we will require to stick to what is necessary for programming
Networking is the concept of two programs communicating across network Whatever it is client-client
client-server client itself
Client:A end device interfacing with human
Server:A device providing serve to a client
Client Server model is most common model like web browser
Peer-to-peer model useful for service that can't be constantly available
client connect to other client with out use of it's core it basically client-server model
Address:An Ip Address
Port:A port number e.g. 5000
Usually port number from 1-1024 are reserved for core protocol
try something above 1024 but below 65535
Sockets:Scokets are the programming abstraction for connection
They allow us to communicate in a bidirectional manner
once they are connected or ready to transmit.We can use them to send dat
and receive data
They implement the common Transport protocols TCP and UDP

Sokets Methods:
1.socket(socket_family,socket_type)
Create a new socket
Socket_Inet -for IPv4 family
Socket_Stream for TCP socket type
2.bind((hostname,port))
Binda takes a tuple of host and port and bind them to socket
3.listen()
start listening for TCP connection
4.accept()
Accepts a connection when found(return a new socket)

----------On client side we use below method---------
5.connect((hostname,port))
Takes tuple of the address of server and port
6.recv(buffer)
Tries to grab data from TCP connection.(Waits)
The buffer size determines how many bytes of data to recieve at a time
6.Send(bytes)
attempt to send the bytes given to it
7.close()
close a socket/connection and free the port

TCP(Transmission control protocol)
Reliable connection based protocol
Ordered & Error Checked(simple checksum)
Used by WebBrowsers,Email,SSH,FTP etc
